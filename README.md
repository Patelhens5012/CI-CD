# CI-CD
Creating a Student Registration Java Spring Boot project with CI/CD using Jenkins involves several steps. Below is a step-by-step guide:

**1. Set up your Spring Boot Project:**

Create a new Spring Boot project using your preferred IDE or Spring Initializr. Include dependencies like Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and H2 Database for simplicity. Implement a basic Student entity, repository, service, and controller.

**2. Configure Version Control:**

Initialize a version control system (e.g., Git) for your project and commit the initial code.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

**3. Create a Jenkinsfile:**

Create a file named `Jenkinsfile` in the root of your project. This file will contain the pipeline script for Jenkins. Here's a simple example:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh './mvnw clean package'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh './mvnw test'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Deploy your Spring Boot application (e.g., copy the JAR to a server)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**4. Install Jenkins:**

Install Jenkins on your server or local machine. Follow the installation guide for your operating system: [Installing Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/)

**5. Set up Jenkins:**

- Open Jenkins in your browser and follow the setup wizard.
- Install necessary plugins (e.g., Git plugin, Pipeline plugin).
- Create a new pipeline job and link it to your Git repository.

**6. Configure Jenkins Pipeline:**

In the Jenkins job configuration, link your Jenkinsfile and configure your Git repository information.

**7. Configure Maven in Jenkins:**

If you're using Maven, configure Maven in Jenkins:

- Navigate to Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins -> Global Tool Configuration.
- Add a new Maven installation and provide the necessary details.

**8. Configure Webhook (Optional):**

For automatic builds triggered by code changes, set up a webhook in your version control system to notify Jenkins.

**9. Run the Jenkins Pipeline:**

Manually trigger the pipeline and monitor the build process.

**10. Enhance the Pipeline:**

Extend the pipeline to include additional steps like static code analysis, code coverage, and integration testing.

**11. Deploy to Production (Optional):**

Extend the pipeline to include a production deployment step. Consider containerization (Docker) and orchestration tools (Kubernetes).

Remember to adapt these steps based on your specific project requirements and infrastructure. This guide provides a basic outline to get you started.
